[Self-Introduction (Irina Fileva) RSS](https://youtu.be/E8gXQ5pirGY);

Hello. My name is Irina.

I am a junior frontend developer.
 
I worked in the past as an office manager, in sales.
I was editing product cards in an online store.
And I've always been interested in how it all works from the inside.
But there was no time to study all this.
In parallel with the main job, part-time riding instructor.
(yes, I ride horses, better than cooking)


And then maternity leave burst into my boring and measured life.
I thought that I should learn something new for myself, that three years were not wasted.


I remembered about an old desire to learn how the site of our online store and called a colleague.
He recommended RSS to me.
Just at that time he was studying at the first stage. 


And I signed up for the zero stage of RSS. 
How I was scared that nothing will work out, can not describe.
But after a week of training I realized that frontend is what I want and will do in the future.
It was exciting.
Sometimes it was hard. My hands were down. 
But when you see that everything is not in vain, that your code works and you get maximum points on cross-checks, it was very inspiring and moved forward.


Having finished the zero stage and received a certificate, I, of course, signed up for the main course.
And here I am. 
Finishing the first stage. My code became better, knowledge is more and I still think that I was not mistaken when I decided to take this path.

Good buy!
