## Reflections ‚úç

### 1. Getting Started with TypeScript üìå
   
**Key learnings:**

TypeScript is an open source language developed by Microsoft. It is an extended version of JavaScript, with certain features that were previously unavailable.\
The main feature of TypeScript is its type system. In TypeScript, you can determine the data type of a variable or parameter by using a type hint.\
Type hints describe the form of an object, which provides better documentation and allows TypeScript to check that your code is working correctly.\
Through static type checking, TypeScript detects code problems early in development that JavaScript normally can't detect until the code is run in a browser.\
TypeScript has more coding features that JavaScript doesn't have:
+ Interfaces
+ Namespaces
+ Generics
+ Abstract classes
+ Data modifiers
+ Options
+ Function overloading
+ Decorators
+ Enter utilities
+ read-only keyword

Browsers only understand JavaScript. For an application written in TypeScript to work, you must compile the code and convert it to JavaScript.<br> 
TypeScript code is converted to JavaScript code using a TypeScript compiler or a TypeScript-compatible transpiler.\
Using compiler parameters, you can control the creation of JavaScript from the original TypeScript.<br> 
You can set the parameters either on the command line or in a JSON file named tsconfig.json.\
Numerous compiler parameters are available

**Skills learned:**
+ Installing the TypeScript compiler in VC Code.
+ Creating a tsconfig.json file.
+ Modifying a few parameters in the tsconfig.json file.
+ Compiled my first TypeScript file.

**How to use them:**
The knowledge gained in this module introduced me to the new TypeScript language, its features and benefits.<br>
In future projects, I will use this knowledge to create projects in TypeScript,<br> 
to identify code problems early in the development process and utilize the features of this language.

### 2. Declare Variable Types in TypeScript üìå

**Key learnings:**

The main advantage of TypeScript is that it allows you to add static types to your JavaScript code.<br> 
Types impose static constraints on program objects such as functions, variables, and properties,<br> 
so that compilers and development tools can provide better validation and assistance during development.

You can associate types with variables through explicit type annotations or through implicit type inference.

All types in TypeScript are subtypes of a single upper type called the any type. <br> 
The any type is the only type that can represent any JavaScript value without restriction.

All other types are subdivided into:
+ primitive types(boolean, number, string, void, null, undefined) as well as enum types.
+ object types (all types of classes, interfaces, arrays and literals)
+ type parameters. 

Class and interface types can be generic types with one or more type parameters.

Union and Intersection types help handle situations where a type consists of two or more possible types.<br>
Literal types allow you to restrict the values assigned to a type to a narrow list of parameters.

If you need to treat a variable as another data type, you can use a type assertion .<br>
A type assertion tells TypeScript that all necessary special checks have been performed before calling a statement.

**Skills learned:**

+ understanding of what types and subtypes there are in TypeScript
+ implementation of types and subtypes for functions and variables
+ understanding of the use of types any and unknown in the moments of development of the year, when the type is not known
+ understanding of the use of literal types to restrict the values assigned to a type to a narrow list of parameters.

**How to use them:**

After taking this module, I learned what types and subtypes of data are available in TypeScript. <br>
I learned how and in what situations to use this information. I learned how to declare the type of a variable and function.<br>
In the future it will help me to assign the correct type to a variable or function.

### 3. Implement Interfaces in TypeScript üìå

**Key learnings:**

In TypeScript, interfaces perform implicit type naming and are an effective way to define a "code contract" in code, as well as code contracts outside the project.

Interfaces can be used to describe an object, to name and parameterize object types, and to compose existing named object types into new ones.

Interface properties can be mandatory, optional, or read-only.

Once an interface is defined, it can be used as a type and get all the benefits of type checking and IntelliSense.

An interface can be used for the following purposes:

+ Creating abbreviated names for commonly used types. 
+ Disk consistency across a set of objects, since every object that implements an interface works with the same type definitions. 
+ Describing existing JavaScript APIs and specifying function parameters and return value types. 
 
Type aliases can act like interfaces. However, there are minor differences. <br>
The key difference is that a type alias cannot be reopened to add new properties, whereas an interface can be easily extended.<br> 
In addition, only a union or tuple can be described using a type alias.

Interfaces can complement each other. <br> This allows members of one interface to be copied into another, providing more flexibility when dividing interfaces into reusable components.

**Skills learned:**

+ Understanding what an interface is in TypeScript
+ Declaring an interface and creating an instance of it.
+ Extending an interface.
+ Declaring an interface with custom array types.

**How to use them:**

In this module, I learned that in TypeScript, interfaces can be used in the same way as in traditional object-oriented programming.<br>
You can also use interfaces to define object types.
That interfaces have properties that are mandatory, optional, or read-only.<br>
That interfaces can be extended.
In the future, interfaces can help me with code reusability and easier refactoring
